# Project2_RAG
This project builds a basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Python. It loads text files, breaks them into chunks, finds the most relevant information for a question, and then uses an AI model to generate an answer. The system helps give accurate, document-based responses by combining retrieval and generation.
